2. VJTI Maps
```
Navigating through the campus is not easy! Even the well-accustomed students need maps to reach their on-campus destination; this is where our maps come into play, they’re convenient to use, zoomable, and at your fingertips. 
```
3. Calendar
```
As scheduling has become crucial in today’s busy world, a student must have a calendar handy to track all the academic and extra-curricular events coming up on campus.
